# No talk

Dialogues are nice ... if you have the talent to catch people and make them interested on what you are saying. For me i feel that depending on the subject i like to take my time explaining my point and if possible with some material supporting my arguments/opinions, it can also be difficult to remember some important things and be precise when having a conversation which can then lead to misinterpretations and so on ... 

My written english is not perfect but the idea of this posts is to give me some time to explain my thoughts or studies/investigations on mainly tech topics, without the feeling of losing someones interest, and here im not interrupted. ðŸ˜Ž

I want to document and share my findings and opinions with others.
