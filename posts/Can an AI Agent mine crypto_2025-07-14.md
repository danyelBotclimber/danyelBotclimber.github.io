# Can an AI Agent mine crypto ?

Today im starting some experiment, i want to train some AI for mining. This is just some trial and also to allow me to learn even more about AI and Crypto.

***

## STEPS:
- Pick AI learning method, most likely reinforcement learning
- Build some Coin based on PoW mining for training and testing
- Chose a real/existing coin to use my AI in it
- Evaluate results
